First, Discord is used as the user interface in order to interact with the application. Each user has a role which decides what commands they have access to, the roles being Educator, Assistant, and Student. When a command is typed the message is read by the bot and anaylzed by the bot. The bot then sends an appropriate response. The application is hosted on SparkedHost which pulls the code directly from GitHub repo\'s main branch. Within GitHub is the main.py file which is ran on the server. main.py also connects to a Supabase Database through a library.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"requirements/system-overview":{"id":"requirements/system-overview","title":"System Overview","description":"Project Abstract","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"requirements/use-case-descriptions":{"id":"requirements/use-case-descriptions","title":"Use-case descriptions","description":"Use Case 1","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"system-architecture/design":{"id":"system-architecture/design","title":"Architecture","description":"Class Diagram","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"testing/acceptence-testing":{"id":"testing/acceptence-testing","title":"Acceptance test","description":"Use Case Acceptance Test will be performed to ensure that certain features are functional and work for the user\'s needs.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"testing/integration-testing":{"id":"testing/integration-testing","title":"Integration tests","description":"Use Case #1 &harr; test_attendance_recording:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"testing/unit-testing":{"id":"testing/unit-testing","title":"Unit tests","description":"Unit tests will be written with pytest for Discord Classroom to test correct functionality of bot and API.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
