It is connected through a URL and KEY pair and creates a Client object when connected. The discord library is used to connect with the Discord Bot through a Discord Token. Also, when creating the bot it needs to know the PREFIX for the commands which is "!" in our case. Finally, FastAPI is used to simplify our API calls to supabase.
